# Finals Brainstorm

### Preamble
- what do you want to solve in the world? what's something you're facing right now that you can solve?
- ex: something not so technical, but got good reception: chrome extension, typecript game, broken pictionary telephone
- chrome extension is just a single js file runs in background

## Considerations and Suggestions

First decision you have to make: what is your wow factor? why would anyone want to use this app? what is the core problem you want to solve? what is that feature that brings everything back together

Don't make anything company-tailored. Companies have seen these apps, so if you're making a clone, you have to ask: why would someone use my clone? What feature am I going to offer that adds to the clone.

Think really big, and you can scale down after. Does it give you the building blocks to implement more ambitious functionality after?

Tech stack: recommend looking into a frontend framework with a backend framework. React and Node, or React and Rails.
  Be careful - all mentors know React and Node, or React and Rails. USE A FRONTEND FRAMEWORK.

If you can, add api or datasets - shows you can read documentation, shows that you know how to implement a tool that you didn't make yourself. 

Research a lot: research what kind of APIs are out there for the project you're trying to do. 


### Scraping

Scraping - cheerio (like jquery)
