### Meetings 

- BEFORE I BOOK A MEETING: does this *need* to be a meeting
- never have a call without an artefact - something you can all review together, and that you can send to others who weren't able to attend, after.
- keep improving that artefact over time.
- ideation not useful in meetings. Take time to diverge and prototype
  - if you're taking too long on the prototype, it's not a prototype, you're just doing the thing!
- meetings are a last resort, not a first option.
- don't overfacilitate meetings

### Learning to work & collaborate remote

- do little iterative experiments to figure out what works for you. Measure if they work.
- set **healthy boundaries** - if you need to get something done and you have notifications popping up, or people pulling you away, you'll have a lot of empty time.
- Write out your problem before you initiate a face-to-face call. 
  - We're working through things at different times - you can consume info when it's relevant to you, and address when/if you're ready.
- treat chat like a sauna - take nice 15 mins, but not in the sauna for 8 hrs.
- set expectations that it's ok to be unavailable.
- be mindful of how much you're reaching out to others, also.
- feel permission to ask someone to write something up.

### Nothing good is built quickly.
- take a second to make sure you understand the problem you're trying to solve.
- a lot of developers will focus on how, but not what and why.
  - before you're deciding *how* you can do something, figure out ***what*** exactly you're supposed to be doing, and ***why*** you're supposed to be doing it

### Wellness

- social interactions are key
- you're getting paid to think, so you have to take care of your mind.
- daily zooms a group, people come and go
- pomodoro technique - work and break blocks ie. 60 min work, 20 min break.
- don't bang your head against the wall, take a break
  - come back, write out the problem (if you don't find a solution on break ;)
