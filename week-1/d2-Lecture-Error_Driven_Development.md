## Error Driven Development

###  *Cause errors first!* 

Create small experiments and debug in small steps. This concept is taken from [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), but a more atomic approach.

### Coding Flow

// comment (in pseudocode) what you're trying to accomplish.

Start with the most simple step first, and run it to see if the output is as you expect.

** *always have a hypothesis of what you expect to see return.* Sometimes your hypothesis can be loose, when you're experimenting with a new method.

Play with different potential solutions in Node
ie: 
- parseInt()
- parseFloat()
- Number()

What do they each return, when do they act differently? You can also read up on documentation, but experimentation will register better, and can be quicker. 

### Exploration Flow 
1. browse documentation to get a general sense
2. experiment with basic cases
3. review documentation for cases/uses didn't think to test?

QUESTION: what's the syntax for multi-line git commit? Is [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5064563/add-line-break-to-git-commit-m-from-the-command-line/5064653) the answer?
