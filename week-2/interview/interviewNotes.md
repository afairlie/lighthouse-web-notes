# Notes from Interview

## 1. Run the Program
*RUN THE PROGRAM - to see what it does.*

You don't just have to try to logic it out without running it to see how it behaves.

## 2. Start with Pseudocode

you might not have the full picture of how you want to execute something. pseudocode out how you think you need to execute something, and then adjust depeneding on what you can do.

## 3. Think Out Loud
*THINK OUT LOUD - say: typically I would do x.*

The interviewer may respond thats not necessary, but they know how you're thinking - and better they know, than that you skip something they want you to do cause you're not sure if it's expected and make the call that it's not.

## 4. Whiteboarding

Think through each step, because you won't be able to lean on your tools and testing. ex. a loop running 0-99 instead of 1-100. 

## 5. Trivia Questions

Be prepared for trivia questions. ie specific behaviours of javascript like truthy/falsey (coertion), comparison operators == vs === (type coertion vs strict equals of type and value).

and to that effect...

## 6. Jargon

 *KNOW YOUR JARGON* - practice this by always referring to things by their proper name, and looking it up if you don't know the name.
